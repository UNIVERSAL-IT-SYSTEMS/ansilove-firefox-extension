You should now have a contextual menu, listed as "Filter Links With AnsiLove" when right-clicking a page.

**Any** link will now open with a image preview when shift-clicked, instead of redirecting to a page or downloading the file from the server. Similarly, keeping alt pressed when clicking a link will open in an emulated terminal display.

Known issues:
- urls pointing to pages are mistaken for images.
